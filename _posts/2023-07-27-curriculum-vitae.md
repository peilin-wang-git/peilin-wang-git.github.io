## About Me

I'm a highly motivated and passionate PhD student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of Prof. Li Tian and Prof. Cai Jing. I'm dedicated to my research and eager to contribute to the academic community with their guidance and support. 

My research focus is mainly on MRI-guided precision radiotherapy. Through this area of study, I aim to utilize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of radiation therapy. By incorporating MRI data into the treatment planning process, I seek to improve the targeting and delivery of radiation to tumors, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues and maximizing treatment outcomes. 

In addition to that, I have a keen interest in deep learning, multi-objective optimization, high-energy physics data analysis, and accelerator optimization. I've also had the opportunity to explore these areas through some hands-on experimentation.
