# [UniverSeg: Universal Medical Image Segmentation](https://universeg.csail.mit.edu/)

## Introduction

This study introduces a novel medical image segmentation model named UniverSeg, designed to effectively segment images encompassing diverse anatomies, image modalities, or labels that extend beyond the boundaries of the training dataset. UniverSeg is rooted in the principles of meta learning / few-shot learning, thereby shifting the paradigm of training deep-learning models from merely 'learning to reflect' to the more sophisticated concept of 'learning to learn'. Concurrently, the architecture of UniverSeg draws inspiration from the UNet model, leveraging its structural attributes to enhance segmentation capabilities. By combining the advancements of meta and few-shot learning with the foundational framework of UNet, UniverSeg represents a pioneering approach in addressing the challenges of versatile medical image segmentation tasks.

KEY WORDS: Meta learning / few-shot learning, UNet model.
