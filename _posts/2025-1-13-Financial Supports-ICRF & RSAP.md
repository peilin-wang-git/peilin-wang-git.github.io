<br/>

## International Collaborative Research Fellowship (ICRF) 
ICRF is a prestigious fellowship that offers a competitive grant to support outstanding PhD students to conduct international collaborative research at top-notch global universities for six months to one year. It aims to enable PhD students to travel abroad and collaborate closely with world-class scholars to tackle pressing problems and train themselves to become future leaders.  

The financial allowance is HK$55,000.

## My research collaboration schedule
I've successfully connected a well-known professor in Cornell University whose research interest lies on developing new technology and extending application of medical image analysis, whcih matches my research topic exactly. If anthing goes smoothly, I will go to Cornell University at May of this year.

## Happy new year you gays!
